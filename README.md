### Self-hosting

**We do not recommend self-hosting Kyoko, as it's hard to setup, requires a lot of API keys and services (image generator server, Lavalink with custom plugins and more) to be fully functional and it's not well documented. We may do release selfhost-friendly edition in future.**

**You have been warned, you are doing everything at your own risk and we will not help you if something went wrong.**

### Building/contributing

If you want to contribute to Kyoko [join our server first](https://discord.gg/ZvDRQf7) and read info in contribution-related channels.

**Steps for building**

1. Clone this repo
2. Navigate to project root directory from terminal (location of cloned repo)
3. Run `gradlew assemble` or `./gradlew assemble` on Unix
4. After successful build, the runtime jar and modules will be placed in `deploy` directory.

If you want to run Kyoko from IDE - remember to execute Gradle `assemble` task on every build, set working directory to `<project root>/deploy` and run it from `Kyoko.jar`. [Look here for example](http://i.imgur.com/EMWG6Ve.png)
